                <p>
                    I'm a skilled developer with a strong background in
                    programming languages such as C and C++. My experience with
                    these languages allows me to tackle complex problems
                    efficiently. I've also solved over 500 Data Structures and
                    Algorithm problems on LeetCode, enhancing my problem-solving
                    abilities and critical thinking, which enables me to develop
                    innovative solutions.

                    In web development, I&apos;m passionate about creating
                    websites that look great and work flawlessly. Using HTML,
                    CSS, and JavaScript, I bring designs to life with a focus on
                    functionality and user experience. I&apos;m also well-versed
                    in frameworks and libraries like Tailwind CSS, React, and
                    Redux, which help me build responsive, scalable applications
                    with ease. Recently, I expanded my skills with the MERN
                    stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), enabling me to
                    develop full-stack applications that are efficient, robust,
                    and maintainable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I&apos;m eager to collaborate with a team where I can contribute
                    my skills across front-end and full-stack development,
                    pushing boundaries and achieving goals together.
